Some helpful test steps:

first when you set up all the enviroment

one of the most important thing is you have to run server first, if not ,when you press any button in client
the client program will crash. Sorry about that I have limited time to do that so I don't do the network connection
check in my client program, also do not type any character in the digit field, it will also crash the program.
I just focus on basic functionality, so this kind of bug ,i know it will exist but haven't fix that now
also when login, select the role please

I don't do the digit validation or format validation, so if the input require a number or time in format,just follow the rule
for example the time format will be xxxx-xx-xx don't change that or using ':' to connect
because in my program ':' is a important connection character(I know it is not proper, but this just for experiment)

steps:
0.start the server !!!!
1.use any  username or password/real id to try login, you will get the messagebox of warning message like user not exist
2.you can press the register button with a role selected
3.input some information(chooese admin or customer) and register, you should success and then you can close that window
4.login with the information you just input(admin or customer) for customer the password is the realID

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
5.if you login with customer, you will get the available flight in a listview, then you can choose one 
and press select seat
6.you will see a form with the flight seat graph, choose some and make order
7.if you don't want to make order any more, you can close the form, the login form will always be there
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
8.if you login with admin, the only thing you can do is add the flight information


That is all of the steps for testing. and if you operate the normal way, it will not crash and will behave like the project 
description. Sorry I have limited time to fix other bugs of desigin and database.

Basically it can deal with seat select conflict and in certain it will support multi client
